This is an attempt to get the jQuery-based HTML-extraction framework http://github.com/fizx/pquery running on Rhino and/or 80legs.  Right now it runs fine in Rhino, and not on 80legs.  Did I mention that this is a giant hack?

You can compile the jar by just running ant, but for some reason, I'm storing the jars in git too, so you don't need to.

You can run locally in Rhino by checking out the source and running the following command in the project folder:

java -jar dist/parsley-on-legs.jar test.let test.html

In theory, if there wasn't classloader hell, you could also run the 80legs tests:

java -Xmx256M -jar 80legsProcessTest_0.83h.jar dist/parsley-on-legs.jar pageinfo.txt index.html test.let

Since that doesn't work, there's little hope of it running on 80legs directly at this moment.
